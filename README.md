# Machine Learning From Scratch
This project was created to teach others how to build a Linear Regression model from scratch. All to often people get abstracted away from the fundamentals of Machine Learning, 
I hope to solidify some understanding of what different Machine Learning models really are (also to help advance my teaching skills).
