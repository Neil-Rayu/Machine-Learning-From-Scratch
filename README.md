This project was created to teach others how to build different Machine Learning models from scratch. All to often people get abstracted away from the fundamentals of Machine Learning, 
  I hope to solidify some understanding of what these models really are.

**Disclaimer: I'm also learning with you when it comes to ML, I'm using this project to make sure I understand concepts.**
