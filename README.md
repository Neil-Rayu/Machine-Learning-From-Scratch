This project was created to teach others how to build different Machine Learning models from scratch. All to often people get abstracted away from the fundamentals of Machine Learning, 
  I hope to solidify some understanding of what these models really are.

<br/>
**Disclaimer: I'm also learning with you when it comes to ML, I'm using this project to make sure I understand concepts.**

## Usage
The different ML tutorials will be created in jupyter files with additional videos linked.
<br/>
> **_NOTE:_**  This should serve more as a guide when one is stuck, I urge you to do these projects on your own via research or linked videos.

## Sources
Statquest Youtube Channel: https://www.youtube.com/c/joshstarmer, this channel has lots of great videos on the topics covered, I will link specific videos when needed.
