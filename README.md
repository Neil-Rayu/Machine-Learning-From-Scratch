# Linear-Regression
This project was created to teach others how to build a Linear Regression model from scratch
All to often people get abstracted away from the fundamentals of Machine Learning, 
I wanted to make this project to help solidify some understanding of what linear regression really is (also to help advance my teaching skills).
